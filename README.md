Tracking Accidents and Casualties across UK Roads in 2021 - 2022
<a name="requirement"/>
### Requirement Gathering

Client wants to create a dashboard on road accidents for the year 2021 and 2022.

#### a. Primary KPIs
- Total Casualties and Total Accident Values:
  - Current Year
  - Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth

- Total Casualties by Accident Severity:
  - Current Year
  - Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth

#### b. Secondary KPIs
- Total Casualties with Respect to Vehicle Type:
  - Current Year

- Monthly Trend Comparison of Casualties:
  - Current Year vs. Previous Year

- Casualties by Road Type:
  - Current Year

- Current Year Casualties by Area/Location & Day/Night

- Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location
Total casualties and total accidents by location

### Understanding Raw Data ü•©
  
Data Grain: A single instance of a reported accident event in the UK in 2021 amd 2022

| ------------- | ------------- |
| Accident_Index  | unique row indentifier (string)  |
| Accident Date  | date of accident event (date)  |
| Day_of_Week  | day of the week (string)  |
| Junction_Control  | mechanism of traffic control at junction (string)  |
| Junction_Detail  | type of junction (string)  |
| Accident_Severity  | severity of accident (string)  |
| Latitude  | latitude (float)  |
| Light_Conditions  | light conditions at accident scene (string)  |
| Local_Authority_(District)  | name of district (string)  |
| Carriageway_Hazards  | hazards on the road if any  |
| Number_of_Casualties  | number of causaulties (integer)  |
| Number_of_Vehicles  | number of vehicles involved in the accident (integer)  |
| Police_Force  | Police force jurisdiction (string) |
| Road_Surface_Conditions  | condition of road surface (string)  |
| Road_Type  | road type (string) |

  <a name="data-cleansing"/>
  
### Data cleansing üßπ
  
Issues
- Junction_Control column has, among others, two values "Auto traffic sigl" and "Auto traffic signal" of which the former is a misspelling of the latter

- Instances where "Fatal" is misspelled as "Fetal" in Accident_Severity column

- "Time" columnwas represented as a datetime data type in Power BI

Fixes
- Used the Replace Values feature to correct the misspellings of Issues 1 & 2
- Changed the data type to time accordingly
- All fixes were done in Power Query

  <a name="data-processing"/> 
### Data Processing ‚öôÔ∏è

- The data needs a calendar table so as to use Time Intelligence functions further down the line.

- Using the CALENDAR function, a new table with calculated, dynamic columns of Date, Month and Year was generated.

  <a name="modeling"/>
### Data Modeling üèõ 

- a one-to-many active relationship was established between the calendar table and the data table 
![Schema](https://github.com/JoshuaOlubori/UK-Road-Accident-Casualties/blob/5e13ba670d1fef8f97a8643586e15cbc5a55f74e/data-model.png)

  <a name="visualization"/>
### Data Visualization üé®

- Power BI magic!‚ú® The report pbix file is available in this repo to explore design decisions
  The following DAX measures were used:
  
```
Count of Accidents = DISTINCTCOUNT(Data[Accident_Index])

Current Year Accident Count = TOTALYTD(COUNT(Data[Accident_Index]),'Calendar'[Date])

Current Year Casualties = TOTALYTD(SUM(Data[Number_of_Casualties]),'Calendar'[Date])

Previous Year Accident Counts = CALCULATE(COUNT(Data[Accident_Index]), SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Calendar'[Date]))

Previous Year Casualties = CALCULATE(SUM(Data[Number_of_Casualties]),
SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Calendar'[Date]))

YoY Accident Count = DIVIDE([Current Year Accident Count] - [Previous Year Accident Counts], [Previous Year Accident Counts])

YoY Casualties = (DIVIDE([Current Year Casualties] - [Previous Year Casualties],[Previous Year Casualties]))
```
  
  <a name="insights"/>
  
### Deriving Insights

- The vehicle type most involved in accidents was cars. This can be explained by the fact that most vehicles plying UK roads are cars

- There is a general decrease in casualty counts in 2022 compared to 2021
