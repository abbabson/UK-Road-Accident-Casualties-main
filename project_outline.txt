1. REQUIREMENT GATHERING
Client wants to create a dashboard on road accidents for the year 2021 and 2022.

a. Primary KPIs - Total casualties and total accident values for the current year and the YoY growth

- Total casualties by accident severity for the current year and YoY growth

b. Secondary KPIs - Total casualties with respect to vehicle type for the current year

- Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for the current year and previous year

- Casualties for road type for current year

- Current year casualties by area/location & day/night

- Total casualties and total accidents by location

2. IDENTIFYING STAKEHOLDERS
- Emergency Services Departments
- Road Safety Corps
- Traffic Management Agencies
- Police Force
- General public

3. UNDERSTANDING RAW DATA
Data Grain: A single instance of a reported accident event in the UK in 2021 and 202
Fields: description (datatype)
Accident_Index: unique row indentifier (string)
Accident Date: date of accident event (date)
Day_of_Week: day of the week (string)
Junction_Control: mechanism of traffic control at junction (string)
Junction_Detail: type of junction (string)
Accident_Severity: severity of accident (string)
Latitude: latitude (float)
Light_Conditions: light conditions at accident scene (string)	Local_Authority_(District): name of district (string)
Carriageway_Hazards: hazards on the road if any
Longitude: longitude (float)
Number_of_Casualties: number of causaulties (integer)
Number_of_Vehicles: number of vehicles involved in the accident (integer)
Police_Force: Police force juridisctionn (string)
Road_Surface_Conditions: condition of road surface (string)
Road_Type: road type (string)
Speed_limit: road speed limit in mph (string)	
Time: time of day accident occurred (time)
Urban_or_Rural_Area: Whether accident occurred in an urban or rural area (string)
Weather_Conditions: weather condition at time of accident (string)
Vehicle_Type: type of vehicle involved in the accident


5. DATA CLEANSING
Issues
- Junction_Control column has, among others, two values "Auto traffic sigl" and "Auto traffic signal" of which the former is a misspelling of the latter

- Instances where "Fatal" is misspelled as "Fetal" in Accident_Severity column

- "Time" columnwas represented as a datetime data type in Power BI

Fixes
- Used the Replace Values feature to correct the misspellings of Issues 1 & 2
- Changed the data type to time accordingly
- All fixes were done in Power Query

6. DATA PROCESSING
- The data needs a calendar table so as to use Time Intelligence functions down the line.

- Using the CALENDAR function, a new table with calculated, dynamic columns of Date, Month and Year was generated.

7. DATA MODELING
- a one-to-many active relationship was established between the calendar table and the data table 

8. DATA VIZUALIZATION
- Power BI

9. DERIVING INSIGHTS
- The vehicle type most involved in accidents was cars. This can be explained by the fact that most vehicles plying UK roads are cars

- There is a general decrease in casualty counts in 2022 compared to 2021
